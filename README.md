Potential future improvements that did not have time to implement:
1)Validate incoming request (could validate that passed amounts and id is positive)
2)In "product-price" endpoint could add totalPrice in response, so that frontend doesn't have to calculate it
3)Extract coefficients to properties file
4)Integration testing whole engine by sending requests to REST endpoint
